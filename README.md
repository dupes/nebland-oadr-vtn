Welcome to the nebland software OpenADR VTN repo.  This repo will be home to the
open source version of our commercial offering.  The github wiki has information on our
[commercial offering](https://github.com/dupes/nebland-oadr-vtn/wiki/Commercial-Offering).

If you're looking for the virtual machine appliance, information is still available
on the [wiki](https://github.com/dupes/nebland-oadr-vtn/wiki/Virtual-Machine-Appliance).

Updates will be pushed to this repo periodically (yearly?).  If you require support
or would like early access to new features, please contact us to find out how you
can join the program: info@nebland.com.
