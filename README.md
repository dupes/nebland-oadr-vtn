**Update April 7th 2020**
This version of the VTN software is no longer being maintained and is severely out 
of date.  It contains many security vulnerabilities and relies on versions of Java
and Rails that are no longer supported. 

Due to lack of interest, we are no longer supporting an open source version of this
software.  We are instead focused on a commercial version which includes discounts 
for universities and other research institutions.  

To learn more about what we offer, visit our website (https://www.gridfabric.io) or
